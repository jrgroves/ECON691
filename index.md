# Economics 691
Here you will find the course material and data that you will need for the Version Control and R parts of Economics 691 taught by Dr. Groves.

## Step One: Download and Install
The first thing you need to do is to download some software that we will be using for the course. Please note that I should be able to help with installation on PCs, but less so with Apple devices.
1. Text Editor

   This is not an absolute requirement because most operating system have a built in text editor. That said, I have found Notepad ++ to be quite useful because it will allow you to write text in just about any language (html, markdown, plain, etc.) and will recongize the format. There are also lots of plugins that you can add depending on what you do.

2. R Core

   The next thing you will need is to install the core R program. R is a free programing language that you can use for pretty much anything and is along the lines of Python. The core R program has many capabilities, however, the real power comes from the packages or "libraries" that you can add to the software. Thes are created by other users and are typically specialized for specific tasks ranging from web scraping to simple regressions.

3. Git

   The next program we will download is Git. This is a version control software and is used to help keep track of changes that are made when you are writting a paper or writing code for a program or project. The idea behind version control is like a library where you can store the main information on the cloud and then update what is there when you have made changes that you want to keep. Another key feature is that it keeps a record of each time you submit changes so you can go back, or revert, to any previous version of a project.

4. R Studio

   The last thing we will download is going to be R Studio and it is going to be our workhorse. In short, it is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows us to access Core R, libraries we download, version control, and many other aspects of a project all in one place. It is even possible to write an entire paper within R Studio and, most importantly, it is free.
