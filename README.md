# Economics 691
Here you will find the course material and data that you will need for the Version Control and R parts of Economics 691 taught by Dr. Groves.

##Step One:
The first thing you need to do is to download some software that we will be using for the course. Please note that I should be able to help with installation on PCs, but less so with Apple devices.
1. Text Editor

   This is not an absolute requirement because most operating system have a built in text editor. That said, I have found Notepad ++ to be quite useful because it will allow you to write text in just about any language (html, markdown, plain, etc.) and will recongize the format. There are also lots of plugins that you can add depending on what you do. [Download Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

2. R Core

   The next thing you will need is to install the core R program. R is a free programing language that you can use for pretty much anything and is along the lines of Python. The core R program has many capabilities, however, the real power comes from the packages or "libraries" that you can add to the software. Thes are created by other users and are typically specialized for specific tasks ranging from web scraping to simple regressions.
