# Step Three: Your First Repository
Now we will create our first repository on GitHub and then pull that onto our personal computer. This is where we will store all of the codes for our projects and it will be the way that I will grade your assignments. Your first repository will be called *ECON691_###* where the three hash marks are your initials. To create a repository, go to [GitHub](www.github.com), log into your account, and click on the green NEW button. In the top dialog box, input the name and then, further down the page, click on the radio button for README file. After making sure this is a public repository, scroll to the bottom and click on create. This will take you to your repository page. You can directly edit items here, but that is beyond the scope of what we are doing so we will skip that. 
## Create Project in R-Studio
To some extent, we are duplicating work because R-Studio has a system where it will keep track of *PROJECTS* which are the same, essentually, as our responsitories. To start a project, go to R-Studio and in the upper-right corner you will see a button that says +PROJECT(none)+ Click on this and choose "New Project". A small screen will open on your computer and you need to click the Version Control banner and then click on the Git banner.

In the next screen you will copy and paste the URL from the respository that you created on GitHub and that will typically autopopulate the Project Name dialog box. The thrid box is were it will live on your computer. I keep mine in a directory in my Documents folder called "Projects" and that is where each of my reserach projects live. If you want to change the default, do so, but it makes little difference.

Once you hit "Create Project" it will appear that R-Studio reloads and we will be ready to start working with R-Studio
