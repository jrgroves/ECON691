# Working With R

## R Basics
R is an object based language being that you create objects that are then modified and used to complete tasks. There are several types of objects within R, but the main examples are  
-Characters (text)
-Numeric (numbers)
-Logical (contains TRUE/FALSE or 1/0)  

The key tool to assign a name to an object is the "<-" or the combination of the less than symbol and the dash. The arrow points to the objects name so if we wanted to assign some text to the object, A, we would type:  
```R
A <- "Hello World"
```
After you type this, you see in R Studio, in our upper-right window under the tab entitled *Enviornment* a new object called A. If something is not in the environment, then R has no idea that it exists. If we click on A, we can see a little drop-down that tells us some facts about the object and if we double-click on A, it will open a viewer window in the upper-left of our screen so we can view the object A. When dealing with data, this viewer will look much like a spreadsheet. Objects are typcially set up as vectors and everything in a given vecto

Many time you will have multiple objects that you want to keep together and where the rows of the different objects are related to each other, similar to a matrix of control variables or rows of a spreadsheet. If the objects are all of the same type (text, numbers, logical), then you can combind them in a
